# Celestini2019
Github repository for Celestini 2019 qualification round


The repository cointains 4 sections:

* Section B has one neural network code , 4 SVM codes(one for each class), 4 SVM curves codes and one dataset.
* Section C has a .py file . It is an unfinished code for section C. It is what we could implement and hence we tried showing     what we did rather than keeping it all blank. 
* Section D has idea submission in pdf folder duly completed. It also has a video showing graphical implementation of our         project. 
* Section E has detailed explanations of our answers. Duly solved.

Thank You!
